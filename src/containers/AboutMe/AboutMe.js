            <P>So...about me.  I am a software developer from Belfast.  I would describe myself as a bit of a generalist though.
                  My previous work includes window cleaning, retail, cleaning a care home, admin at an estate agency, 
                  entertaining groups at an escape room and marketing for a university careers service.  Very conventional.  I'm planning to use this website 
                  as a portfolio of my work as a developer, but also leave some room for my other interests too. 
            </P>

              the characteristics of Erbium Doped Fibre Amplifiers and the binary star BV Cen as a possible supernova progenitor.  
              The BV Cen project involved using the Linux software Molly to analyse spectral data.</p>
