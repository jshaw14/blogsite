            <P>Hope you liked that.  This will be a bio of my life.  I am a software developer from Belfast.  I would describe myself as a bit of a generalist though.
                  My previous work includes window cleaning, retail, cleaning a care home, admin at an estate agency, 
                  entertaining groups at an escape room and marketing for a university careers service.  Very conventional.
